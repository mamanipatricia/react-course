# FIRST ASSIGNMENT

1. Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput :done:
2. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it here
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
9. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
10. Add styling of your choice to your component/elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets.
